# Smart-Delivery-Route-Optimizer

# 🚗 Delivery Route Optimizer (Shortest Path Finder)

A Streamlit web app that helps delivery companies find the **shortest route between warehouses** using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**.

## 🧠 Concept
This project solves a **real-world logistics problem** — finding the most efficient delivery route.  
We model the map as a weighted graph and use **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to compute the shortest path.

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- Python 🐍  
- Streamlit (Frontend + Logic)
- NetworkX (Graph + Dijkstra)
- Folium (Map Visualization)

## ⚙️ How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
